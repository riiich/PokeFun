# PokéFun
A React web application that allows a user to search up a pokemon to see some cool facts about it. There is also a directory of all Pokemons along some facts about them.
There are some hyper links on the right side of the navigation bar that will lead you to a specific page for a specific purpose. Below will describe each page.
- Home: When the web application is initially loaded, this is where you will land. It pretty much describes how you can maneuver around the site.
- Search: Enter a Pokémon into the search bar and click Enter. A card will then appear below displaying some information about your Pokémon.
- Directory: A directory of all the existing Pokémon in the Pokémon world. Click the 'Click Me' to display some information about the Pokémon.
- Searched Pokémons: Displays all the Pokémon that have been searched by the user and also displays its frequency in searches.

That's all there is to PokéFun!
